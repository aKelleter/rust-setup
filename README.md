# Explanations of the main.rs file

The main.rs file is the entry point for the Rust application. This is where the program starts to run. In this file, we have defined an add function that takes two parameters of type i32 (32-bit integers) and returns their sum.

The `main` function then calls this `add` function with the values 5 and 3, and displays the result using `println!`.

An interesting aspect of Copilot is that it can generate code based on the description you give it. But above all, use it more as a coding assistant than as an automatic code generator.
